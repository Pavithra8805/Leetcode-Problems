# Leetcode-Problems

Daily LeetCode practice repository.

## 🎯 Goal

Solve LeetCode problems **every day** to improve:

- problem-solving speed
- data structures & algorithms fundamentals
- interview readiness
- coding consistency

## 📅 Daily Challenge Commitment

- Solve at least **1 problem per day**
- Write clean, readable solutions
- Add time/space complexity notes
- Review and improve older solutions weekly

## 📁 Repository Structure

You can organize by topic and/or difficulty.

## ✅ Progress Tracker

| Date       | Problem | Difficulty | Topic | Language | Notes |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|----------|-------|
| 2026-02-27 | Two Sum | Easy       | Array, Hash Map | Python | First day ✅ |

> Add a new row every day.

## 🧠 Solution Format (Suggested)

For each problem, include:

1. Problem name and link
2. Approach summary
3. Time complexity
4. Space complexity
5. Final code

Example:

```md
## 1. Two Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Approach:
- Use a hash map to store visited numbers and indices.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
```

## 🔥 Streak

- Current streak: **1 day**
- Longest streak: **1 day**

Update this section as you progress.

## 🚀 Motivation

Small daily progress beats occasional big effort.

**No zero days.**

## 📌 Notes

- Consistency > intensity
- Focus on understanding patterns
- Re-solve tough problems after a few days
